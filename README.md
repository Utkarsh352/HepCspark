## Data
The HepCSpark project uses the Hepatitis C dataset, which contains various clinical features and the corresponding target variable indicating the outcome of Hepatitis C patients.

# Features
The dataset includes the following features:
AGE: Patient's age

SEX: Patient's gender

ALB: Albumin - It is a protein synthesized by the liver. Abnormal levels of albumin can indicate liver dysfunction.

ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase - It is an enzyme found in various tissues, including the liver and bones. Elevated levels of ALP can be indicative of liver damage or other conditions.

ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase - It is an enzyme primarily found in the liver. Increased levels of ALT in the bloodstream can be a sign of liver injury or disease.

AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase - It is an enzyme present in various tissues, including the liver, heart, and muscles. Elevated levels of AST can indicate liver damage or other health conditions.

BIL: Bilirubin - It is a yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells. Elevated levels of bilirubin can indicate liver dysfunction or other conditions.

CHE: Cholinesterase - It is an enzyme produced mainly by the liver. Abnormal levels of cholinesterase can be a sign of liver disease.

CHOL: Cholesterol - It is a fatty substance found in the blood. Abnormal cholesterol levels can contribute to liver disease and other health issues.

CREA: Creatinine - It is a waste product produced by muscles and eliminated by the kidneys. Elevated creatinine levels may indicate impaired kidney function.

GGT: Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase - It is an enzyme found in various tissues, including the liver. Increased levels of GGT can indicate liver damage or disease.

PROT: Protein - It refers to the total protein levels in the blood. Abnormal protein levels can be indicative of liver disease or other health conditions.


These laboratory markers are commonly measured to assess liver function, diagnose liver diseases, and monitor the progression of hepatitis.
Models
The project applies machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict Hepatitis C outcomes.

##  Evaluation
The project evaluates the performance of the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
